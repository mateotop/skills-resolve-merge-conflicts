Out of the night that covers me
Black as pit from pole to pole 
I thank whatever gods may be 
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
Looms but the Horror of the shade
And yet the menace of the years 
Finds and Shall find me unafraid 

It matters not how strait the gate 
How chrages with punichment the scroll
I am the master of my fate 
I am the capitan of my soul
